Hey there! My name is Bill and I am an aspiring UX Designer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: strengthening my portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: UX and Web Design, JavaScript
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a classically trained violinist. I can play several instruments (I love to play the drums but I don't dare call myself a drummer) and lately I have dedicated most of my time toward playing the guitar (more specifically, the blues on my Fender Stratocaster).
