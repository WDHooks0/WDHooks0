Hey there! My name is Bill and I am an aspiring UX Designer.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: strengthening my portfolio
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: UX and Web Design, JavaScript
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a classically trained violinist. I can play several instruments (I love to play the drums but I don't dare call myself a drummer) and lately I have dedicated most of my time toward playing the guitar (more specifically, the blues on my Fender Stratocaster).

Please check out my GitHub portfolio here: https://WDHooks0.github.io to see what I'm working on! (Currently, FlexBox and CSS Grid)
